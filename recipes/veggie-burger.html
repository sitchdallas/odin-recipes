    <h1>Veggie Burger</h1>
    <img style="width: 400px" src="../pictures/veggie-burger.jpg">
    <p>This is THE burger. Not just any run-of-the-mill burger you could find at your local restaurant that wants to "support" vegetarians so difficult children feel like they have somewhere to eat. This is a genuinely great burger that is the closest replica to a real burger as you will find (let's face it, that is what we all want).</p>
    <p>It is a mouth-watering delight that will make you ditch those cheap store-bought alternatives and appreciate spending the extra time making something that doesn't make you feel just as fake as the food.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 shallots, chopped (2/3 cup)</li>
        <li>16 oz. mushrooms, mix of shiitake + portobello, stemmed and diced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. tamari</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. mirin, or 1/2 tsp. maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sriracha, more if desired</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ground flaxseed</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked short-grain brown rice, freshly cooked so that it's sticky</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, divided</li>
        <li>Vegan Worcestershire sauce, for brushing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and sauté until soft, 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and a generous pinch of salt, and sauté until soft and browned, 6 to 9 minutes, turning down the heat slightly, as needed.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tamari, vinegar, and mirin. Stir, reduce the heat, then add the garlic, smoked paprika, and sriracha. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the sautéed mushrooms, walnuts, flaxseed, brown rice, and ½ cup of the panko. Pulse until just combined. The mixture should hold together when pinched, but it should still have some texture.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a large bowl and fold in the remaining panko.</li>
        <li>Form into 8 patties, place them on a large plate and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>If you're grilling the patties, preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Brush the patties with olive oil and spray the grill with cooking spray. Place the patties on the grill and use a spatula to press down lightly. Grill for 7 minutes on the first side, flip, and grill for 6 to 7 minutes on the second side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Alternately, cook the patties on the stove. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Coat the bottom of the skillet with oil and cook the patties for 5 to 6 minutes per side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, brush with Worcestershire sauce, and serve with desired fixings.</li>
    </ol>
